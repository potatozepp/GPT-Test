# Simple Tower Defense Game

This repository contains a minimal **3D** Godot project demonstrating a very basic tower defense prototype. The player can place path segments to guide enemies toward the core while a single tower automatically attacks nearby enemies.

Open `project.godot` in Godot and run the main scene to try it out. Press the space bar to place additional path segments.
