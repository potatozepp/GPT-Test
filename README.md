# Simple Tower Defense Game

This repository contains a minimal **3D** Godot project demonstrating a very basic tower defense prototype. The player can place path segments to guide enemies toward the core while a single tower automatically attacks nearby enemies.

Open `project.godot` in Godot and run the main scene to try it out. Press the **Start Game** button to begin. Use **WASD** to move the camera and left click to place additional path segments where the mouse points at ground level. A transparent preview shows where the segment will appear. The settings menu also includes a simple **Hard Mode** toggle that increases the enemy spawn rate. Use the **Edit Paths** button at the top of the screen to pause the action and modify the path.

The main scene includes a basic camera and directional light so the level is visible without additional setup.
