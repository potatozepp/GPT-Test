# Simple Tower Defense Game

This repository contains a minimal **3D** Godot project demonstrating a very basic tower defense prototype. The player can place path segments to guide enemies toward the core while a single tower automatically attacks nearby enemies.

Open `project.godot` in Godot and run the main scene to try it out. Press the **Start Game** button to begin. Use the RTS-style camera: **WASD**/**QE** to move, hold **right mouse** to rotate, **middle mouse** to pan or move near the screen edges to scroll, and use the scroll wheel to zoom. In edit mode, click **Place Path** or **Place Turret** to choose what to place. Left click to add segments or towers at the transparent preview. The settings menu also includes a simple **Hard Mode** toggle that increases the enemy spawn rate. Use the **Edit** button at the top of the screen to pause the action and modify the layout.

The main scene includes a basic camera and directional light so the level is visible without additional setup.
